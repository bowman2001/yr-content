Markdown offers the following syntax to embed an image directly into markdown:  `![alt text](image.logo)`.

Here's a logo example (hover to see the title text):

Inline-style: 

![alt text](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/raw/master/src/common/images/icon48.png "Logo Title Text 1")

Reference-style: 

![alt text][logo]

[logo]: https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/raw/master/src/common/images/icon48.png "Logo Title Text 2"
